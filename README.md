# react-hot-boilerplate

**This is a slightly modified version of Dan Abramov's [React Hot Boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate)**

## Project Notes
- [YouTube Pagination API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/implementation/pagination)

### Here's what I've changed:
- Added SCSS import support
- Added more structure for expandability (ex. if you're trying to create an API using Express)
- Added more basic file structure for a SCSS, Flux/Redux, and MVC
